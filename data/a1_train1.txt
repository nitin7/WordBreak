 With a little guidance from Valentin LRB he draws a beauty spot on her which will eventually be her trademark after finding her in his dressing room RRB Peppy slowly rises through the industry earning more prominent starring roles.
 Two years later Zimmer announces the end of production of silent films at Kinograph Studios but Valentin is dismissive insisting that sound is just a fad.
 In a dream Valentin begins hearing sounds from his environment LRB as does the audience RRB but can not speak himself then wakes up in a sweat.
 He decides to produce and direct his own silent film financing it himself.

 Beautiful.
 Could you give me one more.
 Valentin in his only audible line replies With pleasure.
 revealing his French accent.
 The camera then pulls back to the sounds of the film crew as they prepare to shoot another take.
 Director Michel Hazanavicius had been fantasizing about making a silent film for many years both because many filmmakers he admires emerged in the silent era and because of the imagedriven nature of the form.
 According to Hazanavicius his wish to make a silent film was at first not taken seriously but after the financial success of his spyfilm pastiches OSS 117 Cairo Nest of Spies and OSS 117 Lost in Rio producers started to express interest.
 The forming of the film s narrative started with Hazanavicius desire to work again with actors Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo Hazanivicius s wife who had both starred in OSS 117 Cairo Nest of Spies.
 Hazanavicius chose the form of the melodrama mostly because he thought many of the films from the silent era which have aged best are melodramas.
 He did extensive research about 1920s Hollywood and studied silent films to find the right techniques to make the story comprehensible without having to use too many intertitles.
 The screenplay took four months to write.
 Chief among the influences shaping the screenplays protagonist was Douglas Fairbanks.
 The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences recent book Douglas Fairbanks by Jeffrey Vance as well as the Academys Douglas Fairbanks exhibition and screening events both in Los Angeles and New York City afforded Hollywoods first swashbuckling hero and the Academy s first president some significant media attention.
 Principal photography on The Artist began in November 2010 taking place over the course of thirtyfive days made in the 1331 screen ratio commonly used in the silent film era.
 Though presented in blackandwhite it was shot in color by cinematographer Guillaume Schiffman.
 All the technical details including lenses lighting and camera moves were calibrated to aesthetically match silent films of the period.
 To recreate the slightly spedup look of 1920s silent films the film was shot at a slightly lower frame rate of 22 fps as opposed to the standard 24 fps.
 Most of the film is silent except for two brief scenes with sound as well as the nondiegetic soundtrack.
 Throughout the shoot Hazanavicius played music from classic Hollywood films while the actors performed.
 The film was produced by La Petite Reine and ARP Selection for 1347 million euro including coproduction support from Studio 37 and France 3 Cinema and presales investment from Canal and CineCinema.
 The cast and the crew included both French and American members.
 All the scenes were shot in Los Angeles primarily in Hollywood but also in downtown theaters restaurants and houses including the one in which Mary Pickford lived.
 Soundstage work was done at Red Studios and the studio lot itself doubled for part of the fictional Kinograph Studios lot with Red s Lillian Way entrance doubling as the Kinograph entrance in several sequences.
 The iconic Bradbury Building in downtown LA provided the location for the film s distinctive staircase sequence.
 The dance sequence that closes the film took seventeen takes and required Dujardin and Bejo to spend five months studying tap dancing with Dujardin claiming that in the first week it s fun the fifth week it s a little boring at the end it s thrilling.
 American costume designer Mark Bridges created the wardrobe for the film s cast.
 The film s music was largely composed by Ludovic Bource but includes works by other composers such as Alberto Ginastera s Estancia.
 The soundtrack was recorded in Belgium by the Brussels Philharmonic and was conducted by Ernst Van Tiel the Brussels Jazz Orchestra also cooperated.
 The recording took place during six days in April 2011 at Flagey s Studio 4 in Brussels.
 The film s climactic scene is set to Bernard Herrmann s Scene damour from his score to Alfred Hitchcock s film Vertigo.
 In Vertigo that composition similarly accompanies an extended scene without dialogue.
 Only one song LRB sung with lyrics RRB is used in the soundtrack  Pennies from Heaven  sung by Rose ChiChi Murphy LRB uncredited RRB.
 This song was written in 1936 although the film is set between 1927 and 1932.

 Mark Adams of Screen Daily called the film a real pleasure  propelled elegantly forward by delightful performances from Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo it is the most unlikely of feelgood movies.
 He added however  The film does feel a little sluggish towards the end of the first third as the music is a little repetitive and the intertitles are infrequent but Hazanavicius manages to give the film a real sense of charm and warmth and film fans will be competing to spot visual and musical references.
 Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian described how the film had me on my feet cheering throughout the final credits and stated I ca nt wait to see it again.

 David Thomson of The New Republic called The Artist an accomplished and witty entertainment and went on to write  Whether Hazanavicius can do more things as elegant and touching without the gimmick of silence remains to be seen LRB and heard RRB.
 Meanwhile he is to be congratulated on the grounds of pleasure alone.
 He may be due for much more in the way of rewards.
 Chicago SunTimes film critic Roger Ebert gave the film four stars out of four praising the performances and calling the film one of the most entertaining films in many a moon a film that charms because of its story its performances and because of the sly way it plays with being silent and black and white.
 Writing for Slant Magazine Jaime N Christley gave the film 15 out of 4 stars explaining Michel Hazanavicius ignores everything that s fascinating and memorable about the era focusing instead on a patchwork of general knowledge so eroded of inconvenient facts that it does nt even qualify as a roman a clef.
 America argued that while Jean Dujardin carried the film Bejo s performance was disappointing.
 On 9 January 2012 actress Kim Novak stated that rape had been committed in regard to the musical score by Ludovic Bource which incorporates a portion of Bernard Herrmann s score from Alfred Hitchcock s 1958 film Vertigo LRB in which Novak had starred RRB.
 In the article published by Variety she stated that I feel as if my body or at least my body of work has been violated by the movie.
  This film should ve been able to stand on its own without depending on Bernard Herrmann s score from Alfred Hitchcock s Vertigo to provide more drama and that It is morally wrong for the artistry of our industry to use and abuse famous pieces of work to gain attention and applause for other than what they were intended  ending her comments with Shame on them.
 In response director Hazanavicius released a statement.
  The Artist was made as a love letter to cinema and grew out of my LRB and all of my cast and crews RRB admiration and respect for movies throughout history.
 It was inspired by the work of Hitchcock Lang Ford Lubitsch Murnau and Wilder.
 I love Bernard Herrmann and his music has been used in many different films and Im very pleased to have it in mine.
 I respect Kim Novak greatly and Im sorry to hear she disagrees.
 Hazanavicius also told CNN I used music from another movie but its not illegal.
 We paid for that we asked for that and we had the permission to do it.
 For me there is no real controversy I feel sorry for her but theres a lot of movies with music from other movies directors do that all the time and Im not sure its a big deal.
 In May 2011 when the film was first shown at the Cannes Festival Todd McCarthy from The Hollywood Reporter mentioned the use of Herrmann s music  Hazanavicius and Bource daringly choose to explicitly employ Bernard Herrmanns love theme from Vertigo which is dramatically effective in its own right but is so well known that it yanks you out of one film and places you in the mindset of another.
 Surely some sort of reworked equivalent would have been a better idea.
